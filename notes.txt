Lambda Expression


Same as function
Call it as anonymous block
	Parameters
	Body
	Return Type
Not tied with classes


Why Lambda
input()
token ->
body ()

Advantages

To implement functional interfaces
how its looks like
@FunctionalInterface
public interface iName{
void test(int a, int b);
}
Not tied to any classes
can be assigned to a variable


Functional Interface

A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method

They can have only one functionality to exhibit
  
Lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface

Runnable, ActionListener, Comparable are some of the examples of functional interfaces
Can contain default and static methods

Pillar interfaces in java8

Consumer
Predicate
Function
Supplier
